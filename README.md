To-Do List
# CSS and JS-todo-list
Use JS to make a to-do list.
The list must include:
line-through to cross through items once they are completed.
delete button to erase or hide items once completed
an input box to input new to-do items
an input button which ammends new to-do items to the list


ISSUES
The line-through class extends to the text on the delete button because it tis nested within the li items: need to make an exception
To-do list is not responsive yet
