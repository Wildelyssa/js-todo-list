# ToDo List

## Tech used
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**

## Purpose
A simple todo list, or shopping list which has a default list. The list can be added to, and items can be deleted or crossed through as required. 

## Features
* Responsive design
* Input button to amend new items to the end of the list
* Delete button to delete items as required
* Click on a list item to create line-through, and cross it out as required

## Improvements and Edits
* Line-through property includes the Delete button since it is nested in the <li> element
  * Separate delete button from `<li>` element so style is not inherited, or make a new class/exception for delete button
* Responsive design
   * Decrease size of elements, and look at margins and padding for mobile to make fully responisive
